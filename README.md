Music has a powerful influence on human beings. It can act as a stress buster and help one lighten their mood. A Music Player lets you manage and listen to all your music files quickly and easily. The aim of our project is to create a personalized music player. This application allows one to play songs on desktop or laptops. It focuses on creating an interactive interface which is user friendly. Our application is a speech recognition enabled application that allows one to play songs by voice commands. There are very limited voice-based music player applications for desktop, and they work with third party music players like VLC media player and Windows media player. Our project addresses this limitation by integrating voice search within the media player.
